This project is an end-to-end expense analytics and forecasting pipeline built using Databricks, Delta Lake, and Power BI, designed to gain hands-on experience with modern data engineering and analytics workflows.

The solution follows the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold) to ensure scalable, maintainable, and analytics-ready data processing. Raw expense data is ingested using Fivetran, cleaned and standardized in Databricks, aggregated into business-friendly datasets, and finally consumed in Power BI dashboards. An AI/ML component is included to analyze spending trends and support future expense forecasting.
